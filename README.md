# Disable Google Chrome Auto-Update (Batch Script)

This repository contains a Windows batch script that helps you **disable Google Chrome's automatic updates** by deleting key update folders used by Google Update and GoogleUpdater.

---

##  What Does the Script Do?

- Automatically requests **Administrator privileges** (UAC prompt)
- Silently deletes chrome update files (if present)
- Prevents Chrome from silently reinstalling the update service

> ⚠️ Note: This script **does not disable** Chrome updates via registry or Group Policy. It only removes the components responsible for automatic updates. For more robust blocking, additional configuration may be needed.



##  How to Use

1. **Download** the `.zip` file from [HERE](https://github.com/seedtaha/disable-chrome-upadtes-forever-in-windows/releases)
2. Extract it.
3. Double-click the `.bat` file and allow to give **Administrator rights** when asks for.
4. Wait a second.
5. Done✅.

           <you can visit `chrome://settings/help` in Google Chrome so you can verify that the updates are disabled>
